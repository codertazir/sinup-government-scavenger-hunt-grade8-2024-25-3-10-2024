    <h1>End of an Era: Last Coal-Fired Power Plant Shuts Down</h1>
    <p>
        Britain’s last coal power plant at Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire has closed down for good. This marks the end of the UK's long history with coal, which started 142 years ago. The government decided to shut it down to help the environment and fight climate change. Many people are happy about this change because it means cleaner air, but some workers are worried about losing their jobs.

    <h2>Questions</h2>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>What form of government does this country have?</h3>
        <p>
            The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy. This means they have a king or queen, but the elected Parliament makes the important decisions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>How is the government's decision shaping the lives of its citizens?</h3>
        <p>
            The decision to close the coal plant is changing citizens' lives by helping to create a cleaner environment. However, it also means that many workers at the plant will have to find new jobs. The government is trying to help these workers transition to new careers.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>Do you think the citizens' responses to the decision are influenced by the type of government?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, the citizens’ responses are influenced by the UK’s democratic government. In a democracy, people can express their opinions and influence decisions. Some citizens support the closure for environmental reasons, while others are concerned about job losses.
